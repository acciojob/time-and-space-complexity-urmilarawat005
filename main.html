	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a concept in computer science that deals with the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the size of the input to the program. The time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, to the order of the size of the input. It is very important to understand time complexity as it can help us to assess if our code will run in a reasonable time frame.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity is a concept in computer science that deals with the amount of memory used by an algorithm (space used by the algorithm). The space complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of space or memory taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. It's expressed in big O notation, for example, O(n).</b></p>
